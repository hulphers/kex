
Mainly designed for deep neural networks
API - application programming interface

- What is TensorFlow?
Software library for dataflow programming
Symbolic math library, also used for machine learning applications (such as ANNs)
Used for research and production

- What does it do?
Nodes represent mathematical operations
Edges represent tensors

- How does it work?
The graph of interacting operations is run entirely outside Python (expensive operations like matrix multiplications can be done using other programming languages)


- Why was it developed?
Originally developed by the Google Brain Team (DistBelief, a machine learning system)
(for research)
Was used across different companies
Simplifying and refactoring the codebase --> TensorFlow
Mainly designed for deep neural networks


Do we want to compare with another neural network? Theano? scikit-learn? What is the advantage/disadvantage of tensorflow and why?
vs Theano: A little more mature. TF is still chaning and evolving. API more complex. Less documentation. Longer compilation times
vs scikit-learn: TF more low-level. TF better for deep learning algorithms (takes advantage of GPUs)


Idé: Om möjligt, gå "baklänges" efter att nätverket tränats? Dvs generera bilder som ger maximal aktivering av nätverket (och därmed se hur sådana "optimala tracks" ser ut)
(som DeepDream baserad på ImageNet)

Hur ladda de skapade datafilerna? Borde resultatet hamna i sample_generator_output.dat? Den används aldrig (?)


"The n_classes parameter specifies the number of possible values that the neural network can predict. Since the Iris problem classifies 3 Iris species, we set n_classes to 3."
